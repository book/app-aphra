I wanted to call this project "Hyde", because it's a lot like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (except it's uglier and more powerful) but the Python people [got to the name first](http://hyde.github.io/).

Gabriel John Utterson is another really important character from [the book](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43). It is Utterson's search for Hyde's identity that drives the book's plot.
